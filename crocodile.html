			The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is a crocodilian native to saltwater habitats and brackish wetlands from India's east coast across Southeast Asia and the Sundaic region to northern Australia and Micronesia. It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996.[1] It was hunted for its skin throughout its range up to the 1970s, and is threatened by illegal killing and habitat loss. It is regarded as dangerous for people who share the same environment.he saltwater crocodile is often claimed to be the largest living crocodilian. Males grow to a length of up to 6 m (20 ft), rarely exceeding 6.1 m (20 ft) or a weight of 1,000–1,075 kg (2,205–2,370 lb). Females are much smaller and rarely surpass 3 m (9.8 ft).[3][4] It is also known as the estuarine crocodile, Indo-Pacific crocodile, marine crocodile, sea crocodile or informally as saltie.

            The saltwater crocodile inhabits coastal brackish mangrove swamps and river deltas from India's east coast, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Philippines, Palau, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Australia's north coast. The southernmost population in India lives in Odisha's Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and in Subarnarekha and Budhabalanga Rivers. It occurs along the Andaman and Nicobar Islands coasts and in the Sundarbans.
            In Sri Lanka, it occurs foremost in western and southern parts of the country.In northern Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland, the saltwater crocodile is thriving, particularly in the multiple river systems near Darwin such as the Adelaide, Mary, and Daly Rivers, along with their adjacent billabongs and estuaries. The saltwater crocodile population in Australia is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 adults. Its range extends from Broome, Western Australia through the entire Northern Territory coast all the way south to Rockhampton, Queensland. The Alligator Rivers in the Arnhem Land region are misnamed due to the resemblance of the saltwater crocodile to alligators as compared to freshwater crocodiles, which also inhabit the Northern Territory.
