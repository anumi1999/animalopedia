                                                Have u seen on floor just before putting your leg on it. Wait up!!! you will find it there. A small insect of mere size of a rice grain 
                                                is capable of lifting heavy weights which is 100 times its own weight. It's rightly said that courage is not always shown by lion in its roar, It's also in the silence of ants working patiently , persistently and never giving up.

                                                    A wolf has a very bad reputation that it gained from its cunning nature. This wild freak can eat any animal bigger than it 
                                                    alone. Perhaps the most well known characteristic of the grey wolf is its penetrating, hauntingly beautiful howl. This is a primary communication tool, both between lone wolves and their pack, as well as between packs.
